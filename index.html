    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Curtis, co-founder and lead developer of binaryblade, a software consultancy 
      designed to help companies and individuals improve their online presence.</p>
    
    <p>We are a husband/wife team (she's the right-brained artist and I'm the left-brained 
      engineer) using our combined specialties to make the web a little less like the 90's.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>You used to be able to list yourself in the Yellow Pages and the work would just flow 
      in. But times have changed. In the 21st century you need a much more comprehensive
      marketing strategy. One that needs to incorporate modern technology trends.</p>
    
    <p>Our services fall into several broad categories:</p>
    
    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>New projects offer the most flexibility and lowest cost. We are able to help you start
    things off on the right foot with a professional project plan. We work with you to 
    analyze business needs for a new project and create a roadmap complete with branding and code
    elements.</p>
    
    <p>You choose whether to take this plan and implement it yourself, or utilize our custom
    design and development services.</p>
    
    <p>Although new projects often benefit the most from this roadmapping process, we can also
    help when projects stray <a href="#problems">off-track</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Design & Development</h3>
    <p>We break down seeming complex project requirements into a prioritized action plan. You have full control of priority (though some tasks are related and will have prerequisites that need to be completed first). Often we identify a particular project to be comprised of multiple sub-projects: some static and some dynamic. Reimplementing things as a series of the smallest possible subsets of features will often speed up planning, design and development, minimize costs, and maximize return on investment.</p>
    
    <p>As an example, we have separated out our website functionality into a static marketing website (this site which isn't frequently updated), a blog (regularly updated content, but infrequently updated layout), and a series of small web applications (fully dynamic, often able to be productized). This provides a maximum amount of flexibility during and after development.</p>

    <h3>Problems?</h3>
    
    <p>No one starts a project wanting to fail. However, software is hard. Deadlins often slip due to many possible factors. You're worried that you might be in trouble. But are you really, and if so, how much?</p>
